###History

v0.0.1
======

Drivers cannot (yet) set the device name when registering, so the nickname is only used in the guid. @dan has promised to see if he can make it happen "soon" though =)

Give it a go, tell me if works for you and I'll get onto writing the part to actuate the players.


###Borrowing from...

This borrows alot from the ninjablock XMBC module found here: https://github.com/elliots/ninja-xbmc
The squeezebox communication is using the good work from here https://github.com/mozz100/node-logitechmediaserver


###Contributions
